Writing this from a cafe across the street from my hotel in Da Nang.

Perhaps the most hectic week of my life:
- Lost my passport at the airport; found it 5 minutes before doors closed
- Went to Bangkok for an internship
- Quit the internship after realising itâ€™s not for me
- Flew to Da Nang because I canâ€™t stay on an ED visa
- Flying back to BKK tomorrow since I have rent and wanna stay a little longer

Some good stuff did happen:
- Launched ProNotes Gold and made some money
- Worked on some really exciting features I can't wait to launch.
- Explored Da Nang while working on ProNotes - where has this been all my life?
  - Countless cafes - service is amazing, plugs everywhere, free water - it's all I ever wanted.
  - I'm obsessed with beef noodles
  - The beaches ðŸŒŠ

My plans this summer:
- Continue doing what I love - making Mac apps
- Grow ProNotes and pick up some product/growth/marketings skills
- Git gud at guitar and gym
- Write more and write better
- Explore more of Bangkok and Thailand

I'm really grateful I recovered from a year of burn-out right before Summer 2024. Let's get this money.
