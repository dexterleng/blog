  <p>Last semester, I was taking some difficult &amp; verbose courses - linear algebra, computer organization, discrete maths. I refused to move on until I absolutely understood everything mentioned in the lecture. The result? I was stuck on chapter 2 for linear algebra until the finals, and ended up with a 2.6/5 GPA that semester. Funny story - I went to the exam and wrote only C for all my MCQs, left my written portion empty, and walked out an hour early with a B grade somehow. God knows why I didn&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>My thought process was - Surely I&rsquo;m missing something. I&rsquo;m probably just one reading away, maybe if I rewatch this lecture I&rsquo;ll get it for sure&hellip; it&rsquo;ll click any time now, right? Well, sometimes it never does.</p>
<p>While there is some honour in being persistent, and I probably have some
masochistic tendencies, unfortunately I found out the hard way that learning is not really a linear process. To be an effective learner, you can&rsquo;t just lock-in, you must give yourself a time box to figure something out, and if you can&rsquo;t - move on to something else - be it the next chapter, another course, or just take a nap. There may be something mentioned in future readings that will unblock you.</p>
<p>During finals week, this video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzXZ4-KzBLs">Stop Trying To Understand</a> came across my YouTube feed. It resonated with me so deeply and I wished I chanced across it earlier. Give it a watch.</p>
<p>Next semester I&rsquo;m going to give up more.</p>
