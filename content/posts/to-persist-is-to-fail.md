Last semester, I was taking some difficult & verbose courses - linear algebra, computer organization, discrete maths. I refused to move on until I absolutely understood everything mentioned in the lecture. The result? I was stuck on chapter 2 for linear algebra until the finals, and ended up with a 2.6/5 GPA that semester. Funny story - I went to the exam and wrote only C for all my MCQs, left my written portion empty, and walked out an hour early with a B grade somehow. God knows why I didn't fail.

My thought process was - Surely I'm missing something. I'm probably just one reading away, maybe if I rewatch this lecture I'll get it for sure... it'll click any time now, right? Well, sometimes it never does.

While there is some honour in being persistent, and I probably have some
masochistic tendencies, unfortunately I found out the hard way that learning is not really a linear process. To be an effective learner, you can't just lock-in, you must give yourself a time box to figure something out, and if you can't - move on to something else - be it the next chapter, another course, or just take a nap. There may be something mentioned in future readings that will unblock you.

During finals week, this video titled [Stop Trying To Understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzXZ4-KzBLs) came across my YouTube feed. It resonated with me so deeply and I wished I chanced across it earlier. Give it a watch.

Next semester I'm going to give up more.
