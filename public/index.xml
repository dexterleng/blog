      <description>Last semester, I was taking some difficult &amp;amp; verbose courses - linear algebra, computer organization, discrete maths. I absolutely refused to move on until I absolutely understood everything mentioned in the lecture. The result? I was stuck on chapter 2 for linear algebra until the finals, and ended up with a 2.6/5 GPA that semester. Funny story - I went to the exam and wrote only C for all my MCQs, left my written portion empty, and walked out an hour early with a B grade somehow.</description>
