<!-- # Hi, I'm Dexter ðŸ‘‹ -->

I'm an incoming Year 2 Computer Science student @ National University of Singapore. I would say I'm pretty damn good at Mac development. I've created several revenue generating Mac apps while I was in high school & army. One of my projects - [Homerow](https://homerow.app) was acquired in 2024 for five-figures. I've worked on popular Mac apps like [MacGPT](https://www.macgpt.com) as a freelancer.

I'm currently working on [ProNotes](https://pronotes.app). It's a macOS extension for Apple Notes that adds markdown, slash commands, AI, and other good stuff. Exploring reverse engineering, AI agents, and whatever peaks my interests really.

Over the years I discovered I love building things that *shouldn't* be possible - at least not at first glance. It's why I made the apps I made.

Outside of work, I play guitar & gym.

### Projects

- [ProNotes](https://pronotes.app)
