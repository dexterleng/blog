<!-- # Hi, I'm Dexter ðŸ‘‹ -->

I'm a incoming Year 3 Computer Science student @ National University of Singapore. I enjoy Mac development and reverse engineering. I've created several revenue generating Mac apps while I was in high school & army. One of my projects - [Homerow](https://homerow.app) was acquired in 2024 for five-figures. I've worked on popular Mac apps like [MacGPT](https://www.macgpt.com) as a freelancer.

I'm currently working on [ProNotes](https://pronotes.app). It's a macOS extension for Apple Notes that adds markdown, slash commands, AI, and other good stuff. Exploring compilers, kernel dev, and whatever peaks my interests really.

Over the years I discovered I love building things that *shouldn't* be possible - at least not at first glance. It's why I made the apps I made.

### Projects

- [ProNotes](https://pronotes.app)
- [Homerow](https://homerow.app) (acquired)
- [TextPal](https://textpal.app)
- [Shiny (a Swift interpreter)](https://github.com/ravern/shiny)

### Careers

I will be working in San Francisco as a software intern at [Software Applications Incorporated](https://software.inc) from May to Nov 2025. I'm looking for a Summer 2026 internship in these areas:

1. Mac/iOS dev
2. Reverse engineering
3. Compilers
4. Kernel dev
